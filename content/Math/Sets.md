### Sets
A set is a collection of distinct numbers or objects. Each object is called an element or member of the set.

### Intersection and Union
Two sets A and B are disjoint or mutually exclusive if they have no elements in common.
The union of two sets are all the elements they have in common.

### Compliments
The universal set U is the set of all elements we are considering.
The complement of a set A is the set of all elements of U that are not elements of A. The complement of A is written A’.

### Special Number Sets
- Natural, counting numbers (N)
- Integers (Z)
- Positive Integers (Z+)
- Rational Numbers (Q)
- Irrational Numbers (Q') - Interesting!
- Real Numbers (R)

### Interval Notation
To describe this set: {—2, —1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Use the interval notation: {x € Z | -3 < x < 5}

### Venn Diagrams
These are diagrams used to visually display the sets and their relationships.
