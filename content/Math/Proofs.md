# Proof by induction
Show true for $n=1$, or some low number
Assume true for $n=k$.
Show true for $n=k+1$
proved by induction.
# Proof by contradiction
Assume the opposite is true. Find logical shortcoming. Shown true for opposite. Normally its with evens and odds, divisibility, and common factor between two primes for irrational questions.
# Direct proof
Isolate variables and put them together, very straightforward
