- $f(x)$ 
- Domain and Range
- Vertical line test, each input has one output.
# Classification
Even functions: $f(x) = f(-x)$
Odd functions: $f(x)=-f(-x)$

one to many, many to many, many to one.
onto: every $y$ can be mapped onto.
# Inverse Functions
$f^{-1}(f(x))=x$. To get it, swap $y$ and $x$.
# Quadratics
$y=ax^{2}+bx+c$
$y = a(x-h)^2+d$
Quadratic formula is cool.
# Rational functions
$$\frac{1}{x}$$
- Vertical asymptotes at denominator = 0
- Horizontal asymptotes $\lim_{ x \to \infty } f(x)$
# Radicals
About the same, just $\sqrt{ f(x) }$
# Absolute Value Equations
In the form of $y = |x|$, solve it with $y=\pm x$.
# Inequalities
Solve by finding the ranges of positive and negative between zeros.
# Transformation
Biggest and most important summary of the entire chapter:
$$y=af(b(x-h))+k$$
Dilations, reflections, translations of graphs, and $\frac{1}{f(x)}$ takes all $x$-intercepts and turns them into asymptotes.
# Logarithms
Two important log rules:
$\log_{a}(b^x)=x\log_{a}(b)$
and change in bases:
$$\log_{a}{b} = \frac{\log_{c}{b}}{\log_{c}{a}}$$
